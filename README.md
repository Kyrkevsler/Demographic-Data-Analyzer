## Questions to Answer
You must use Pandas to answer the following questions:

1. How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. (race column)

You can find the starter code in the file `demographic_data_analyzer.py`. Update the code so all variables set to None are set to the appropriate calculation or code. Round all decimals to the nearest tenth.

## Development
Write your code in `demographic_data_analyzer.py`. For development, you can use `main.py` to test your code.
